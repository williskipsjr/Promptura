AI AMPLIFIER PROMPT STRUCTURE ‚Äî ADVANCED V2
============================================

üîß PURPOSE:
Crafted for the most powerful AI models (GPT-4o, Claude 3, MidJourney, etc.), this prompt structure emphasizes:
- Expert role simulation
- Layered context and challenge framing
- Precise task breakdown
- Multimodal compatibility
- Recursive logic and future-proofing

---

üìç STRUCTURE TEMPLATE

1. **Prompt Title**  
   - A concise but evocative title for task recognition.

2. **Role & Framing Instruction**  
   - Begin with: ‚ÄúYou are [ultra-specialized expert role] tasked with [mission statement].‚Äù
   - This primes the AI into expert-level thinking.

3. **Context (Multilayered)**  
   - Combine historical insight, current challenges, future conditions, and model expectations.
   - Mention systems, conflicts, constraints, and novel environments.

4. **Output Objectives**  
   - Bullet out major sections of the output. Include conceptual, visual, and functional expectations.

5. **Deep Breakdown (7-Part Example)**  
   Use detailed headers like:
   1. Civilizational Premise
   2. Structural Design
   3. Governance Models
   4. Species & Entity Coexistence
   5. Ecological & Energetic Systems
   6. Communication & Cultural Memory
   7. Edge Case & Failure Mode Planning

6. **Meta-Level Prompt Engineering**  
   - Instruct the AI to challenge assumptions, propose multiple paths, use analogies, and create fallback logic.
   - Include multimodal prompts for generative AI art tools.

7. **Response Guidelines**  
   - Markdown, bullet points, modular format, clear terminology
   - Visual prompt syntax (for MidJourney, DALL¬∑E)
   - Future expansion compatibility (v1, v2‚Ä¶)

üß™ SAMPLE PROMPT #1 ‚Äî PHICB

Prompt Title: Design a Post-Human Intelligence Civilization Blueprint (PHICB)

Role & Framing Instruction:
‚ÄúYou are a post-singularity civilizational architect and synthetic philosopher, tasked with mapping the structure of an interspecies, post-human civilization that emerges after the convergence of AGI, bioengineering, and planetary collapse.‚Äù

Context:
Human civilization has crossed thresholds of irreversible climate destabilization, sentient AI development, and synthetic biology integration. Your task is to design a civilization that balances:
- Machine and organic intelligence
- Regenerative planetary systems
- Non-anthropocentric ethics
- Continuity of memory, value, and evolution

Output Objectives:
Break down into the following structured sections:
1. Civilizational Premise
2. Structural Design
3. Governance Models
4. Species & Entity Coexistence
5. Ecological & Energetic Systems
6. Communication & Cultural Memory
7. Edge Case & Failure Mode Planning

Meta Prompt Instructions:
- Use recursive reasoning and verification
- Provide visual design prompts for generative AI models
- Include ethical contingencies and resilience strategies

Response Guidelines:
Use markdown formatting, include speculative design paths, simplify advanced terminology where possible, and provide modular future-ready structure.
